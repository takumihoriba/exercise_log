# Exercise log and recommendation

## What will this application do?

This application will keep track of activities a user enters and suggest activities so that a user can achieve their weekly goal. I expect users will be those who want to exercise but are sometimes unsure of what to do, which includes me. I am motivated to develop this application because it will be useful if there is an app that recommends me some activities when I want to do some exercises  **based on some factors**. The factors might be activities completed in last week, user's preference, and/or how much exercise is needed to achieve the weekly goal. In this project, I'd like to **simplify** calculation of amount of exercise by relying on time duration user inputs. 

## User stories

In this project:

- As a user, I want to be able to add exercise to this application *for multiple times*
- As a user, I want to be able to see recommendation of exercise when I request
- As a user, I want to be able to set/modify a goal
- As a user, I want to be able to see how far I am from achieving that goal
